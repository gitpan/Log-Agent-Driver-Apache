Log-Agent-Driver-Apache
=============================

This is a driver for Log::Agent for use in mod_perl environments.

Log::Agent is the standard logging module for perl. (Well, thats
what I've been told anyhow)

This driver, combined with Log::Agent, allow you to use the Log::Agent
functions and have the results go to the apache server log.

A neat side effect of this is that if you have modules that aren't 
tied to mod_perl, you can use Log::Agent with an alternate driver
for testing and development. Also, if your project grows or in some
other way requires other forms of logging, (say, syslog for example)
making the change is simple.
